## Judge with simple_form gem
- New App generated by my template.rb (github.com/KudosX/template.rb):
- Ruby 2.3.1
- Rails 5.0.0.rc1
- able to get judge gem to work without simple_form gem but, with simple_form gem installed and judge-simple_form gem installed I get `undefined method 'error_notification' for #<Judge::FormBuilder:xxxxxx>` in views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb
